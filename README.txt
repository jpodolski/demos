This is a public dropbox of 40 short demos that I show to potential/current 
collaborators and friends. It is intended to best display the range in the kinds of 
stuff I want to write, the chord progressions I use, and the production techniques
I'm interested in. 

There are a few things to note:

  - It's recommended that you download the folder from Dropbox if you have the
    space (53MB). Many of the uncompressed file formats won't play in Dropbox's
    built-in player.

  - A lot of these are loops, so most of the time you don't need to bother with 
    listening to the whole file, you'll get the gist in the first minute.

  - They're numbered within folders. It's a recommended listening order based 
    simply on how much I like the demos.

  - To appease my insecurity: Note that these demos go back to ~2011, and so I've 
    improved a good bit as a musician, and especially as a vocalist since then.
    "09 sandbox.mp3" contains a recent recording of me dubbing harmonies.

  - I know this is a lot of effort for a demo folder, and I may seem overeager, but 
    really I'm just serious about finding a likeminded collaborator(s). I wanted to 
    assemble a decent sample of stuff that I could show to many people, rather than
    sending bits and pieces to everyone I talk to. If this stuff isn't for you,
    that's fine! We can work on a different genre, or not at all.

  - If it happens that you do like what you hear, this is just a fraction of around 
    200 scraps, song starts, and miscellaneous ideas, so let's get collaborating!

Thanks for checking this out, I hope we work together.
