This is a public directory of 40 short demos that I show to potential/current 
collaborators and friends. It is intended to best display the range in the kinds of 
stuff I want to write, the chord progressions I use, and the production techniques
I'm interested in. 

There are a few things to note:

  - It's recommended that you download the folder from Github if you have the
    space (53MB). Many of the uncompressed file formats won't play in Github. You
    can clone the repository or download it as a zip in the top-right corner.

  - A lot of these are loops, so most of the time you don't need to bother with 
    listening to the whole file, you'll get the gist in the first minute.

  - They're numbered within folders. It's a recommended listening order based 
    simply on how much I like the demos.

  - All parts in these tracks were recorded and mixed by me. The lofi samples
    looped through a DD7 pedal, and drummed over in real time. Most of those are
    recorded onto a phone. The others are overdubbed in Logic using virtual amps 
    and software instruments, with the occasional use of MIDI drum samples.

  - To appease my insecurity: Note that these demos go back to ~2011, and I've 
    improved a good bit as a musician, and especially as a vocalist since then.
    "09 sandbox.mp3" contains a recent recording of me dubbing harmonies if you're
    curious.

  - I know that this is a lot of effort just for a demo folder, and that I may seem 
    overeager, but really I'm just serious about finding a likeminded 
    collaborator(s). I wanted to assemble a decent sample of stuff that I could show to many people, rather than sending bits and pieces to everyone I talk to. 
    If this stuff isn't for you, that's fine! We can work on a different genre, or 
    not at all.

  - If it happens that you do like what you hear, this is just a fraction of around 
    200 scraps, song starts, and miscellaneous ideas, so let's get collaborating!

Thanks for checking this out, I hope we work together.
